Analyze NCEL Pick 4 numbers

Claude Sonnet 3.5 Summary

Repository Analysis: lsimpson762/pick4
This repository contains a Python program for analyzing North Carolina Education Lottery (NCEL) Pick 4 numbers. Here's a breakdown:

Purpose
The repository is designed to analyze the distribution of numbers in NCEL Pick 4 lottery drawings, separating day and evening draws.

Key Components
p4.py: The main Python script that:
Tracks frequency distribution of digits (0-9) for each position in the 4-digit number
Separates analysis between day (D) and evening (E) drawings
Identifies the most and least frequent digits in each position
NCELPick4.csv: Contains historical lottery data with columns for:
Date (not directly used in analysis)
Draw time (D for day, E for evening)
Four digits of the winning number (columns 2-5)
out.txt: Likely contains output from running the program
Code Analysis
The program:

Initializes 8 lists to track digit frequencies (0-9) for each position (1-4) for both day and evening draws
Reads the CSV file and counts occurrences of each digit in each position
Calculates and displays:
Raw distribution counts
Highest frequency digits with their positions
Lowest frequency digits with their positions
Total number of drawings analyzed
Potential Use Cases
Identifying patterns in lottery number distributions
Finding "hot" numbers (most frequent) and "cold" numbers (least frequent)
Statistical analysis for lottery number selection strategies
Limitations
The code performs basic frequency analysis but doesn't include more advanced statistical methods
No predictive modeling or probability calculations
No visualization of the data
